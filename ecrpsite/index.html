        <h2>Weapons</h2>
        <ul>
            	<li><img src="images/weapon_8_ball.jpg" alt="8 ball side pocket">A solid sphere of misfortune, perfectly weighted for a striking finish. Its unsuspecting roundness belies the mortal impact it can leave. Aim straight, shoot fast, and just like on the billiard table, it's game over.</li>
            	<li><img src="images/weapon_rock.jpg" alt="Big ass rock">A testament to the brutal simplicity of nature. It's raw, it's heavy, it's blunt. This rock leaves a geological mark on the victim, proving that Mother Earth also has a dark side.</li>
		<li><img src="images/weapon_bottle.jpg" alt="Bottled up">With a swig of doom and a smashing follow-through, this weapon leaves a trail of broken glass and dreams. An elegant, yet deadly tool that brings a new meaning to "bottle service."</li>
            	<li><img src="images/weapon_ace.jpg" alt="Ace to the face">Not just for serving aces on the court, this racket makes an astounding connection between sport and crime. When swung with a vengeance, its sharp impact leaves victims in a permanent deuce.</li>	
		<li><img src="images/weapon_boobtube.jpg" alt="Boob tube">A box of dreams, a portal to another world, and an incredibly hefty piece of furniture. One swift swing of this vintage monstrosity, and it's less "Channel Surfing," more "Channel Crossing."</li>
            	<li><img src="images/weapon_bucket.jpg" alt="Bucket beatdown">A tool of innocence turned instrument of chaos. The bucket might be empty, but it sure knows how to fill a room with fear. Whoever said, "kick the bucket" definitely had a different scenario in mind.</li>	
		<li><img src="images/weapon_hammer.jpg" alt="Hammer time">A builder's friend becomes an investigator's nightmare. With a rhythmic swing and a solid hit, it’s a deadly dance that ends in a chilling crescendo. Can’t touch this...literally!</li>
            	<li><img src="images/weapon_pipe.jpg" alt="Pipe dream">Cold, heavy, and unforgiving. This brutal piece of plumbing brings a whole new meaning to pipe down. It delivers a blow that's hard to forget and even harder to survive.</li>
		<li><img src="images/weapon_pistol.jpg" alt="Pistol whip">The unexpected flip side of a gunman's friend. This weapon's not for shooting, it's for an old-fashioned smackdown. The irony of a non-firing firearm delivering the fatal blow is palpable.</li>

        <h2>Locations</h2>
        <ul>
            	<li><img src="images/location_1st.jpg" alt="1st Ave">The heart of the city that never sleeps, 1st Ave bustles with life, dreams, and the occasional back-alley misdeed. It's a place where one can lose themselves or, in our unfortunate victim's case, their life.</li>
            	<li><img src="images/location_aquarium.jpg" alt="Aquarium">A tranquil haven of marine life, turned aquatic crime scene. Amid the swirling colors and placid waves, our victim met a fate more suited to a shark tank than a day at the Aquarium.</li>
		<li><img src="images/location_park.jpg" alt="Park">Amid lush greenery and the laughter of children, our victim's life was snuffed out. Tranquil Park's quiet beauty now shrouds a grisly secret, making a stroll in the park less leisurely.</li>
            	<li><img src="images/location_pier.jpg" alt="Pier 62">Usually a scenic retreat of salty sea air and aged wooden planks, Pier 62 hides a darker tale. The victim's last gasp was likely drowned out by the constant lapping of water against the pier's steadfast pillars.</li>
		<li><img src="images/location_pike_market.jpg" alt="Pike Market">Amongst the fresh produce, artisan bread, and bustling vendors, Pike Market hides a chilling secret. Fresh fish isn't the only thing on ice in this beloved local haunt.
</li>
            	<li><img src="images/location_pike_place.jpg" alt="Pike Place">Known for its vibrant market and lively trade, Pike Place's cacophony of sights, sounds, and smells serves as a fitting distraction from its newly-acquired dark history. Who knew the exchange of life could be a commodity?</li>
		<li><img src="images/location_pike_street.jpg" alt="Pike Street">Once a bustling hub of Seattle, Pike Street's vibrance now hides a grim tale. Between the modern facades and historic charm, the pavement retains the echo of a life lost.</li>
            	<li><img src="images/location_post_alley.jpg" alt="Post Alley">A whimsical labyrinth of cobblestones and murals, Post Alley now holds a darker mystery. The winding paths have led our victim to a grim, permanent detour.</li>
		<li><img src="images/location_waterfront.jpg" alt="Water Front">Known for its stunning vistas and the gentle hum of boat traffic, the Waterfront's serenity was shattered by our victim's untimely demise. The serene waters tell a haunting tale of the crime that took place on their peaceful shores.</li>
            	<li><img src="images/location_police_station.jpg" alt="Police Station">Situated in the heart of Seattle, this imposing edifice echoes with stories of justice served and crimes thwarted. Behind its solid façade lies a whirlwind of activity: ringing phones, busy detectives, and a constant parade of blue uniforms. It is the nerve center of the investigation, where the puzzle pieces of this perplexing murder case are painstakingly put together.</li>

        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of the investigation is to solve for the murder weapon, the location and the murderer.  Your job is to eliminate possibilities by collecting clues from the Emerald City location list. You will find the locations in the linktree here: <a href="https://linktr.ee/emerald_city_rug_pull?utm_source=linktree_profile_share&ltsid=f260a30b-06c4-4653-8ef5-d50c2bb67d63" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary">Emerald City Rug Pull Linktree</a> <br>
Clues are collectible with a Polygon wallet (your "clue book"), but collecting them is not necessary to solve the case.  You can write them down instead.<br>
Right now the game is only playable on OVER the Reality on mobile devices.  Download the app to start the investigation.
<br>
Once you have found all the clues, come back to this linktree to fill out the "Rookie report" to tell us your solution.  Correct solutions recieve the complete set of game cards and get staked in the Founder's last collection: "The Cyberpunk Collective: Galactic Refugees"
