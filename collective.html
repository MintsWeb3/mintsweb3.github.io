        <p>
            The Cyberpunk Collective: Galactic Refugees is an NFT collection created by 'The Founder,' the victim of our game's murder mystery. It comprises intergalactic refugees who escaped from the destruction of the Cyber Planetary System. The characters in the collection are not just fascinating figures but are part of the unfolding narrative of The Emerald City Rug Pull game. This collection was released just before the tragic death of 'The Founder.' Dive into their world and explore the mystery.
