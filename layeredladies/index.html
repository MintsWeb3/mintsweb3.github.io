        <p>Welcome to the home of Layered Lady Playing Cards, a collection of 10,000 unique digital playing cards. Each one is its own unique work of art. This project was born when my mom shared a piece of her art with me - it featured a woman made up of many "layers". <img src="inspiration.jpg" class="img-portrait img-fluid rounded-3 shadow-lg" alt="Leta Mae original art"></p>
        <!-- Rest of the paragraph here... -->
        <p>This was right when I was learning generative art techniques, so I decided to take my mom's art as inspiration. I brought it into Figma, traced each layer, separated them, and created variations. I also added new layers like the playing card values.</p>
        <p>The end result is a one-of-a-kind collectible trading card game and art experience. They are also NFTs, and now that I've created this collection, I can do anything I want with it. Each NFT will be verifiable on the blockchain, creating a permanent record and value for collectors. My goal is to keep adding utility - I want to host games, events, and more for holders.</p>
        <p>Beyond just the art, this collection represents my journey back to the arts thanks to my mom's inspiration. As a kid, I was amazed by her constant tinkering and wide range of artistic crafts. I always wished I was that creative. Decades later, mom is still crafting away, and this digital collection tips my hat to her for motivating me to finally channel my own art.</p>

        <p><span class="badge bg-secondary">My mom,</span> Leta Mae has always been an artistic tinkerer. <img src="leta.jpg" class="aside-img img-fluid rounded-3 shadow-lg" alt="Leta Mae Self Portrait circa 1980">When I was young, she constantly had a new craft project she was mastering - pottery, sewing, painting, you name it. I was always in awe of her talents and wished I had her creative gifts.</p>
        <!-- Rest of the paragraph here... -->
        <p>Mom could whip up beautiful works of art seemingly effortlessly in every medium. Our house was always filled with her latest passion, whether it was cross stitch, papier mache, or homemade candles.</p>
        <p>Now many years later, mom is still at it. Even in her late 70s, she's constantly developing new skills like furniture refinishing and watercolor. I finally started embracing my own creative side thanks to her lifelong inspiration. This digital art collection is just one way I'm trying to carry on her legacy of artistic tinkering.</p>
